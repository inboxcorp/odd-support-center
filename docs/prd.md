# Support Center Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version: 1.0**  
**Date:** September 13, 2025

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
* **For the Business:** To transform the support scheduling workflow from a costly operational bottleneck into an efficient, scalable process by significantly reducing administrative overhead and eliminating booking errors.
* **For Managers & Staff:** To provide a single, clear source of truth for all assignments, which simplifies daily planning, balances workloads, and makes dispatching new jobs nearly instantaneous.
* **For End Customers:** To deliver a modern and professional self-service experience that provides the convenience of effortless booking and the confidence of clear, proactive communication.

### Background Context
This project addresses the operational bottleneck caused by a manual and fragmented scheduling process. The current system leads to wasted administrative time, a high risk of errors, and a frustrating experience for customers. By creating a purpose-built module within Odoo, we can provide role-specific views and automated workflows that solve the interconnected needs of managers, staff, and customers in a way that generic, non-integrated tools cannot.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **FR1:** The system shall display a central calendar with appointments visually represented by color-coded statuses.
2. **FR2:** The system shall provide role-based calendar views: Managers can see all technicians, while Technicians can only see their own schedule.
3. **FR3:** Authorized internal users shall be able to create, edit, and assign appointments from within Odoo.
4. **FR4:** Every appointment created must be associated with a corresponding ticket in the custom Helpdesk module.
5. **FR5:** The system shall provide a secure API endpoint to allow authenticated external systems to create new appointments.
6. **FR6:** The system shall automatically send a confirmation email to the customer upon a successful booking and a reminder email 24 hours prior to the appointment.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **NFR1:** All user actions within the internal calendar (e.g., creating a booking) must complete in under 500ms.
2. **NFR2:** Access to view and manage appointments shall be secured using Odoo's native role-based permission model.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The internal user interface should prioritize clarity and speed, enabling managers and staff to understand schedules and make decisions with minimal clicks. It must feel like a native, responsive part of the Odoo backend environment.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
* The primary interface will be a visual, full-screen calendar.
* Color-coding for appointment status is a core interaction principle.
* Modal windows (pop-ups) will be used for creating and editing appointments to keep the user in the context of the main calendar view.
* **Implementation Note:** To achieve the specific functionalities required (e.g., the multi-technician manager's view), this will be a **custom-built calendar view** within the module, not an extension of Odoo's generic Calendar application.

### Core Screens and Views
1. Manager's Team Calendar View
2. Staff Member's Personal Calendar View

### Accessibility
The interface should adhere to WCAG AA standards to ensure usability for all employees.

### Branding
The UI will use Odoo's standard backend theme to ensure a consistent and seamless experience for users familiar with the system.

### Target Device and Platforms
The primary target is a desktop browser, as this is the standard environment for Odoo backend users.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Polyrepo
* The custom module will be developed and maintained in its own single Git repository. This is a standard and clean approach for managing individual Odoo modules that can be deployed to your self-hosted instance.

### Service Architecture: Monolithic Integration
* The module will be designed as a tightly integrated component within your main Odoo application, not as a separate microservice. This ensures seamless operation with other Odoo functions like Helpdesk.

### Testing Requirements: Unit Testing
* For the MVP, the minimum requirement will be to include unit tests that cover the core business logic (e.g., scheduling rules, API data validation). More comprehensive integration testing can be added in a later phase.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* The calendar interface will be a **custom-built view** to accommodate the specific feature requirements, rather than an extension of Odoo's generic Calendar app.

## Epic List

### Epic 1: Core Foundation & Calendar View
**Goal:** Establish the core module structure, data models, and provide a basic, view-only calendar and list interface within Odoo for both managers and staff.
